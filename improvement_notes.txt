Observations and plan (v0.65 review)

Findings:
- /api/ai/plan uses provider before it is assigned, causing NameError and 500. (fixed)
- Planner prompt contains garbled strings for Chinese labels (e.g., WeChat, Search), likely hurting plan quality. (fixed)
- Renderer screenshot capture sets status to busy but does not reset on failure or empty data. (fixed)
- VLM enable/disable relies on a global flag in executor, risky for concurrent runs. (fixed)
- Minor cleanup: duplicate import in executor; requirements are unpinned; test coverage light for FastAPI/frontend. (partial: duplicate import fixed)

Planned fixes (step-by-step):
1) Record notes (this file).
2) Fix provider ordering bug in /api/ai/plan and add regression test.
3) Replace garbled prompt strings with correct text.
4) Add screenshot capture error handling/status reset in renderer.
5) Address VLM flag concurrency or document follow-up.
