Graduation Project: Design and Implementation of a Multi-Modal Large-Model-Based PC Assistant

Scope and Objectives
- Enable natural-language-driven PC operation on Windows through multimodal perception and planning.
- Demonstrate a practical intelligent automation agent that improves productivity and showcases multimodal LLM integration.

Functional Requirements
- Perception: capture screenshots (multi-monitor), run OCR with bounding boxes, and perform fuzzy text localization to identify UI elements.
- Intent Understanding: use an LLM planner to produce structured ActionPlans containing allowed actions and parameters.
- Execution: provide a general-purpose executor for window management and application activation; mouse movement, clicks, dragging, and scrolling; keyboard input and hotkeys; file system operations; and generic UI interactions.
- Feedback Loop: after each action, capture a fresh screenshot, verify state, and retry when required to reach intended outcomes.
- Modular Architecture: separate layers for perception, planning, execution, memory, and safety.
- Safety: enforce safe execution constraints and guardrails around sensitive operations; log actions and errors for traceability.
- Generality: avoid app-specific hardcoding; operate across applications using observable UI cues; support browser automation (searching, clicking images, saving content).
- Cross-Application Operability: handle multi-step tasks such as opening apps, sending messages, managing files, searching the web, and downloading assets.
- Error Handling and Logging: provide robust error detection, retries, and structured logs for diagnostics.

Non-Functional Requirements
- Robustness: consistent behavior under varying UI layouts, resolutions, and minor OCR noise.
- Extensibility: allow adding new action types and higher-level skills without disrupting existing modules.
- Modularity: maintain clear boundaries among perception, planning, execution, memory, and safety components.
- Safety: prioritize constraints that prevent unintended destructive actions and require validation for sensitive steps.

Success Criteria
- Execute representative multi-step desktop tasks using only natural-language instructions.
- Show reliable feedback-driven execution with verifiable state checks and retries.
- Demonstrate cross-application automation without app-specific scripts.
